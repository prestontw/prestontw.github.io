          Hi, I'm Preston! 🙆🏼‍♂️. I like programming languages, board games,
          ultimate frisbee, and pickleball! I'm trying out this blog to write
          about programming and games.
        </p><p>
          I've been to Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, Malaysia,
          Portugal, and Puerto Rico. I've lived in Texas, Tennessee, Rhode
          Island, and Massachussets in the 'States, and in Pest in Hungary.
