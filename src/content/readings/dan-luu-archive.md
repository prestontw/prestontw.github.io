I really like Dan Luu's writing---I've definitely gone down the rabbit hole reading his blog.
Here are a couple of his articles that I think about frequently:

- [Normalization of deviance](https://danluu.com/wat/):
  I think about this article when someone onboards. I try to pay attention to weak signals.
  But, people who are onboarding have to balance learning something new with "Oh, this is different so it's an issue."

- [Why is it so hard to buy things that work well?](https://danluu.com/nothing-works/):
  I like to think of this article as its URL: "nothing works."
  This is an article I think of every time I try to integrate with a service at work, especially when the integration doesn't work exactly as I would like it to.
