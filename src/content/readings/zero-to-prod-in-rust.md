An awesome book, especially if you haven't set up a server yourself before.
I really like its focus on testing and how it walks through the majority of what you need
to get started with backend web server development, including authentication and authorization, logging, and, again, testing.

One companion piece to this is [Notes on Luca Palmieri's Zero to Production in Rust](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/notes-on-zero2prod-rust/) by Chris Allen.
I agree with a couple of the recommendations in this link (using `docker-compose`, `diesel`), so I held onto it.
It might be worth reviewing the recommendations in this article as you finish up chapters in _Zero to Production in Rust_.
