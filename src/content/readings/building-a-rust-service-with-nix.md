The article series that finally pushed me to try Nix for my local development.
If that interests you, start with [9. Learning Nix from the bottom up](https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix/part-9),
but I think it's worth it to read the series in order.
I don't yet generate Docker images through Nix (the one time I tried I ran into deployment issues),
but using Nix is great for local development! (Except for when I'm a version behind on MacOS
and it seems like the [rest of the Nix world has moved forward](https://github.com/prestontw/nix_fails_to_find_git).)
